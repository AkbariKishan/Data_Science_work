# Statistics, Data Science, AI & ML

This repository has been created to store my projects, notes, and learnings related to the field of Data Science. It includes projects executed using various data science and machine learning techniques. I have used data sets from various open source data repositories. 

`Scope` : This work is mainly around execution of these state of the art techniques in the python environment using various supporting libraries. It does not cover intensive maths behind the algorithms. However I have attached various resource links in some of the notebooks to better understand them from the overview perspective. I strictly believe that before trying to understand or use these notebooks, a good knowledge of these techniques and algorithm behind them is necessary.
